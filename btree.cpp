	* Type 1 : Let f be the first-child pointer in p, and let g be the node-group 
	* pointed to by f. We create a new node group g0 with one more node than g. 
	* All the nodes from g are copied into g0, with the node in g that was split 
	* resulting in two nodes within g0. We then update the first child pointer f 
	* in p to point to g0, and de-allocate g.
	*
	* Type 2 : we have to create a new node group g0 and redistribute the nodes 
	* in g evenly between g and g0. Half the keys of p are transferred to a new 
	* node p0, whose first-child pointer is set to g0. To achieve this split of 
	* p into p and p0, the node-group containing p must be copied as in the first 
	* case above, or, if that node group is also full, we need to recursively 
	* split the parent of p.
